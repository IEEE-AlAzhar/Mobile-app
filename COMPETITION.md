# The projects of the competition
Here's the list of the projects to pick to contribute to our code base and their requirements:
1. Users item screen at the navigation drawer.
2. Notifications. 

**All API Docs needed will be given as soon as you are accepted as a contributer in the project**

# Users item screen at the navigation drawer.
Currently, there are four items in the navigation drawer:  **Profile Page, Night Mode, Setting Page and Sign out.**
The task here is to provide another item in the navigation drawer to open a page which all users of the app will be listed there.
But there is a thing here, this screen should be a widget that will only be visible if the user is of type "admin" and 
thus he/she will be allowed to view all users in the team and see their profile pages, if the user is a "committee head" 
he/she will be able to list all the the committee members only, and if the user is neither any one of these this item will 
be completely invisible to him/her.


# Notifications. 
In the announcements page, a list of announcements are viewed in a list.
The task here is to push a notification according to the type of the user in according to the type of the announcement.
If the announcement is of the type "general", so a notification has to be pushed to all users across the app.
But if the announcement is of the type "operational" for example ,so , only the users who belong to 
the operational committee will be notified and so on.

**All clean code enhancements and bug reports and fixes will be regarded and be validated in the competiton according to their quality.**
